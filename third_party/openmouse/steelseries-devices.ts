/**
 * SteelSeries per-PID catalog.
 *
 * SteelSeries is a multi-family vendor: rivalcfg alone documents four
 * incompatible Rival 3 command sets (Gen 1, Gen 2, Wireless, Wireless Gen 2),
 * and libratbag distinguishes four more protocol versions for older mice. The
 * `family` field selects which codec module drives a product; command bytes,
 * framing, and value tables live in that module, never here, and no family's
 * codec branches on product id.
 *
 * Only PIDs whose protocol has been traced to a public implementation belong
 * here. The Rival 3 Gen 2 (`0x1870`) is deliberately absent: its command
 * set is documented as different from every family below, and listing it
 * would claim a device this codec would misprogram. The Rival 3 Wireless
 * Gen 2 (`0x1872`) is present with family `"rival3-wireless-v2"` — its own
 * module, `./rival-3-wireless-v2.ts`, with an XY DPI command and no
 * lighting. The Rival 3 Wireless (`0x1830`) is present with family
 * here. The Rival 3 Wireless Gen 2 (`0x1872`) is deliberately absent: its
 * command set is documented as different from every family below, and
 * listing it would claim a device this codec would misprogram. The Rival 3
 * Gen 2 (`0x1870`) is present with family `"rival3-v2"` — its own module,
 * `./rival-3-v2.ts`, with an XY DPI command no other family shares. The
 * Rival 3 Wireless (`0x1830`) is present with family
 * `"rival3-wireless"` — its own module, `./rival3-wireless.ts`, distinct from
 * both Rival 3 Gen 1 and Aerox 3 (different command bytes throughout, a
 * different DPI sensor table, and, unlike either wired family, a readable
 * battery/firmware state — see that module's doc comment).
 *
 * The Aerox 3 (`0x1836`, family `"aerox3"`) is a separate protocol family
 * from Rival 3 despite both being SteelSeries, single-byte vs. two-byte
 * command prefixes and all — see `./aerox3.ts`'s doc comment, including its
 * reconciliation of PR flozz/rivalcfg#269's Rival 3 Gen 2 claim (shipped as
 * its own `"rival3-v2"` family instead: its DPI command differs from
 * Aerox 3's even though most other commands match).
 *
 * The Aerox 3 Wireless (`"aerox3-wireless"`, four PIDs across its USB-cabled
 * and 2.4 GHz dongle modes, see `./aerox3-wireless.ts`) shares nothing with
 * the wired Aerox 3 beyond the name: its command set is Aerox 5 Wireless's,
 * with a shorter 6-button mapping packet.
 *
 * The Aerox 5 is split across **two** families despite one product line and
 * mostly-shared command bytes: `"aerox5"` (`0x1850`, the plain wired mouse —
 * see `./aerox5.ts`) and `"aerox5-wireless"` (the separately-sold Aerox 5
 * Wireless, six PIDs across its USB-cabled and 2.4 GHz dongle modes — see
 * `./aerox5-wireless.ts`). The two families' polling-rate byte values and
 * RGB zone-color packet shapes differ even though several other command
 * bytes match; do not assume one family's codec for the other's PIDs.
 *
 * The Aerox 9 Wireless (`"aerox9-wireless"`, four PIDs across its
 * USB-cabled and 2.4 GHz dongle modes — see `./aerox9-wireless.ts`) is its
 * own family, not folded into `"aerox5-wireless"` despite sharing the same
 * `_patch_command`-style wireless-flag transform and several command bytes:
 * its RGB zone commands, dim timer, and battery read match Aerox 5
 * Wireless's byte-for-byte, but it defines no button-mapping command at all
 * (`./aerox9-wireless.ts`'s doc comment) where Aerox 5 Wireless does, and
 * its product-id space is disjoint from every other family here.
 *
 * The Prime+ (`0x182C`, family `"prime-plus"`) is its own family per this
 * rollout's per-cluster scoping, even though — see `./prime-plus.ts`'s doc
 * comment for the full corroboration-gap disclosure — its rivalcfg profile
 * (`prime_plus.py`) is byte-identical to plain Prime's (`prime.py`). The
 * plain Prime PIDs (`0x182E`, plus `0x182A`/`0x1856`) reuse this family's
 * codec; no separate module exists.
 *
 * The Prime Mini Wireless (`"prime-mini-wireless"`, PIDs `0x184A` wired /
 * `0x1848` 2.4 GHz — see `./prime-mini-wireless.ts`) is its own family for
 * the same reason: rivalcfg documents it and the plain (non-Mini) Prime
 * Wireless as one shared `settings` dict inside
 * `prime_wireless_wired.py`/`prime_wireless_wireless.py`. The plain Prime
 * Wireless's PIDs (`0x1842` wired / `0x1840` 2.4 GHz) reuse this family's
 * codec; no separate module exists.
 *
 * The Sensei Pro / Rival Pro (`"sensei-rival-pro"`, base station `0x1880` /
 * dongle `0x1882` — see `./sensei-rival-pro.ts`) is its own family per the
 * same rule: a distinct command set (raw-uint16 XY DPI with per-preset
 * lift-off/landing, dual report/polling rates up to 8000 Hz) reconstructed
 * from the vendor's own SteelSeries GG device specification rather than
 * from rivalcfg, which does not cover these mice. The four models share one
 * specification and report the model themselves; only the station and dongle
 * USB product ids are registered.
